Minimizing churn of subscription product through analysis of financial habits

Subscription products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries These products can come in the form of a ‘one size fits all’ subscription, or in multi-level membership. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in, companies almost always try to minimize customer churn(a.k.a subscription cancellations). To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral patterns that act as catalyst in disengagement with the product.

Market: The target audience is the entirety of a company’s subscription base. They are the ones companies want to keep.

Product: The subscription products that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users may not have imagined, or that they may have forgotten.

Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn, so that the company can focus on re-engaging these users with the product. These efforts can be email reminders about the benefits of the product, especially focusing on features that are new or that the user has shown to value.

The data set in this project is for a fintech company that provides a subscription product to its users which allows them to manage their bank accounts(saving accounts, credit cards, etc), provides them with personalized coupons, inform them of the latest low-APR loans available in the market, and educate them on the best available mehods to save money( like videos on saving money on taxes, free courses on financial health, etc).

The purpose of the project is to  identify users who are likely to cancel their subscription so that the company can start building new features that they may be interested in. These features can increase the engagement and interest of our users toward the product.

DATASET

By subscribing to the membership, customers have provided data on their finances, as well as how they handle those finances through the product. Moreover, they have provided demographic information during the sign-up process.
Financial data can often be unreliable and delayed. As a result, companies can sometimes build their marketing models using only demographic data and data related to finances handled through the product itself. Therefore this project will be restricted only to using that type of data. Furthermore, product-related data is more indicative of what new features we should be creating as a company.
